                <p class="secsubtag textsmall">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching,
                    training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                    guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in
                    formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                    feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                <p class="secsubtag textsmall">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                    knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                    orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation
                    to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.

                <p class="secsubtag textsmall">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                    purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                    classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject.
                    Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational
                    choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the
                    physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment,
                    class size, educational activities, and more.
                    The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a
                    statistical base to compare education systems In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25
                    fields</p>
